<h2> Music </h2>

<p>Disco is a genre of music that became popular in the United States in the 1970s. Disco was known for its upbeat catchy tempo played by electric pianos, synthesizers (a type of piano) and guitars. The vocals are also known to be repetitive. Artists that have made an influence in the Disco world were singers such as Donna Summer, Bees Gees, Gloria Gaynor, and Kool & the Gang. Although Disco did not last long, artists were able to leave a legacy.</p>

<h2> History </h2>

<img src="images/girlgroup.jpeg" width="600" height="360">

<p>Disco is known to come from the 1970s, but did you know that it wasn’t popular until the late 70s and early 80s? Disco was slowly introduced in the early 70s but didn’t take a boom until the movie “Saturday Night Fever” with John Travolta premiered. After the premiere, disco was at its peak in popularity. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Disco did not last long after the Disco Demolition Night occurred. The event took place in Chicago, Illinois after a radio station announced a promotion at a White Sox baseball game. The promotion was if fans brought in a disco vinyl they would only pay ninety eight cents for the admission. In between games, the disco vinyl’s that were collected were placed in crates in the middle of the baseball field, until suddenly an explosion occurs destroying all the vinyl’s causing fans to storm to the field. Label records were afraid to label themselves as Disco due to fear of losing supporters. Though the popularity of Disco declined, other genres of music were created that were inspired by disco such as House Music, DJ Culture and early Hip-Hop.</p>

<p>Not only did Disco change music, but it also changed fashion. The disco style was usually go big or go home. Women would wear flowy dresses, tight-knitted jumpsuits, crop tops, and bell bottoms. The men were usually seen wearing three piece suits, pointy collars popped out, platform shoes and medallions. </p>
